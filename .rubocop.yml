# Do not modify any of these rules without running your changes past the `@techleads` Slack group.

# In order to make CodeClimate run in less than 30 minutes (the time-out), we're temporarily turning off
# some of the low-risk, high-frequency cops.  This should be a temporary solution.  We should either
# fix all of these issues across the codebase, or tune the cops to only pull up these issues when they
# matter (e.g. setting the max line length to 120 instead of 80)
